# MultiSpectralImageStacking
This project uses arcpy, opencv and python to automatically combine multiple 3 channel images into single 6 channel tif images 
on which image classificaitons can be run. It then runs those image classificaitons and outputs a vector on which edge detection 
can be refined to identify bedding planes in rock outcrops.
